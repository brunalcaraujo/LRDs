# Little Red Dots Spectra

This repository contains the spectra of LRDs from [de Graaff et al (2025)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv251121820D/abstract) and code to read, convert, and plot them into [multi-panel figures](Panels) (e.g. 4×2 panels). 

Here, we have 121 spectra from 103 different sources. We did not find the spectra of 13 objects from the program MoM (GO-5224; PIs: Oesch & Naidu).

Find more details about each object in [de Graaff's catalog](deGraaff2025_lrds_withdups_blackbody_eline_fits.fits).  


## To do next
- try to find the 13 spectra from MoM (GO-5224; PIs: Oesch & Naidu);
- fit the spectra with different models.
